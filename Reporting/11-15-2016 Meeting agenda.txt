Reporting bugfix meeting.
Starts: CSC110 Start, Ends: CSC110 Start + 30;

Start:
	Set deadlines for each issue deliverable in 11-13-2016 PatLog
	5 minutes each MAX! If a deadline is not agreed upon by end of your alloted time, one will be assigned.
	
Start + 20:
	Rollout reporting structure. 
	
Parking Lot* pre-load:
	Who takes up Die Roll method
	
	
*Paring Lot items are only covered if there happens to be time after all agenda items are adressed, in the order in which they are placed into the Parking Lot.
	If any Parking Lot items aren't covered in the meeting where they are placed in the Parking Lot, they will be rolled over to next meeting's Parking Lot
	
P.S. I will be running a timer to keep us honest with time keeping in the meeting. Assume this to be the case for all future meetings called by me.

Thanks,
~Patrick R. Conner
